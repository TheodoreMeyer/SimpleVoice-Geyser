# Simple Voice Geyser
A Geyser Extension to allow bedrock clients to connect with Simple voice Chat

## What are Geyser extensions?
Geyser Extensions are the equivalent of “plugins”, but specifically for the Geyser platform. This brings the advantage of them being platform-agnostic, meaning that you won’t have to worry about supporting all platforms individually. Additionally, they will be, by design, only applied for Bedrock players joining via Geyser.

## What can The extension do?
- Allow Bedrock Players to voice chat with Java Players through a web interface
